# Python Token Counter
* This simple program takes python code, removes whitespaces, and counts the tokens and lexemes in a reserved dictionary. 
* The code is reusable and modifyable.
* A flow map of how this works: Python code gets its whitespaces removed and is appended on a list > list gets written to an output file > a series of functions are called to count tokens and lexems > the result is printed.
* Note: This current experimental version of the program is for a specific project. All keywords, possible variables, etc. Have not been considered for the purpose of making this program.
